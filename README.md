# JS-Mini-Projects
This repository features beginner-level basic JavaScript projects. All projects presented here were created independently by me, without following any tutorials or copying code. Some projects are versions of work I previously completed by following tutorials, but in this case, they were recreated from memory and past experience, demonstrating my understanding and application of JavaScript.
